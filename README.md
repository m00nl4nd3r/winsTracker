# 🐺 Win Tracker

A single-file, browser-based tool for logging and organizing work wins throughout the year — built around the **STEEP performance framework** (Stronger Together, Own the Outcome, Lead the Way, Execute).

No install. No server. No account. Open the file and go.

## Features

### 📊 Dashboard
Win counts by STEEP standard and by quarter, a category bar chart, and a recent wins feed — all scoped to the active year.

### ➕ Log Win
Structured form with cascading fields: Year → Quarter → Standard → Category → Title → Description, plus optional impact level, proficiency level, manager-tracked flag, and metric/count. Check **"Log another after saving"** to stay on the form and keep logging without extra clicks.

### 🏆 All Wins
Full filterable, sortable table across all years. Filter by year, standard, quarter, impact, or proficiency. Full-text search across title, description, category, and metric. Edit or delete any win inline.

### ✎ Edit Wins
Click the edit button on any row in All Wins or Quarterly View to open a pre-populated modal. All fields are editable — including year, quarter, standard, and category. Changes are saved in place without affecting the win's original creation timestamp.

### 📅 Quarterly View
Per-quarter breakdown with a year selector. Wins grouped by STEEP standard. Edit and delete buttons on every row.

### 🗂 All Years
Year cards showing win counts at a glance, plus a year-over-year breakdown table comparing all four standards side by side.

### 📋 Standards & Rubrics
Built-in reference for all 12 STEEP strands with full Developing → Approaching → Proficient → Exceeds descriptors.

### ⚙ Data Management

| Action | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| **Download Backup** | Exports all wins as a timestamped `.json` file |
| **Restore — Merge** | Imports a backup, adds new wins, skips duplicates by ID |
| **Restore — Replace All** | Imports a backup, overwrites all existing data |
| **Clear History** | Deletes wins for a specific year or all years, with confirmation |

### 📤 Exports

| Format | Description |

## Data & Privacy

All data is stored locally in your browser via `localStorage`. Nothing is transmitted anywhere. The file has no runtime dependencies beyond Google Fonts (loaded from CDN for display only).

**Recommended workflow:**
- Log wins regularly as they happen
- Export a `.json` backup after any significant session
- Store backups in a personal folder, OneDrive, or Google Drive
- Re-import from backup if you switch browsers or clear your cache

---

## Migrating from v1.0 or v2.0

v3.0 shares the same `localStorage` keys as v2.0 — just open the new file and your data is already there. It also auto-migrates data from the original v1.0 storage keys (`packWins`, `packWins_v2`), including converting FY-labeled years to calendar years.

---

## Browser Compatibility

Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Edge 90+, Safari 14+. Responsive layout works on mobile.

## Running with Docker

If you'd rather run the tool on a local web server instead of opening the file directly, a Docker setup is included.

**Requirements:** [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (with Compose)

### Start

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Then open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

### Stop

```bash
docker compose down
```

### Rebuild after updating the HTML file

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

> **Note:** The tool still uses `localStorage` for data storage, so your wins are saved in the browser — not inside the container. Data persists across restarts as long as you use the same browser.
